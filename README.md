# Better YouTube Shorts

YouTube Shorts features a video player without seeking and volume controls. 
Without these controls, users lose the ability to easily skip to specific parts of the video, adjust the volume to their liking, or control their viewing experience in any meaningful way, leading to a frustrating and counterintuitive experience for users.

This browser extension improves YouTube Shorts user experience by redirecting you to the standard YouTube video player when you watch Shorts. It also adds back the missing channel names under the Shorts videos on the front page in case you want to know who a video is from before you click on it.
